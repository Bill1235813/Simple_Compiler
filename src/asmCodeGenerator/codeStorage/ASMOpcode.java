//ABSTRACT STACK MACHINE
//the machine described here consists of a stack (called the accumulator), a
//separate memory array, and a separate instruction store.  There is also a PC
//(program counter) that holds the address (in the instruction store)
//of the next instruction to execute.

//The accumulator (having, say, 1024 locations) is used for most operations.
//Each accumulator location holds either an integer or a floating-point value.
//The content of memory location m in the memory array is denoted MEM(l);
//the memory is of some large size and m must be a non-negative int.
//Each memory location is one byte long.  Floats and integers are stored in 8 and 4 memory
//units, respectively.   IMEM(m...m+3) means the four memory locations m, m+1, m+2, m+3 treated
//as an integer.  FMEM(m...m+7) is similar for a floating-point number.

    // (top element(s) of accumulator stack) must be integer.
